Project Description

This design is based on the concept of scrolling. As you scroll along the y-axis, the scrollY value in JavaScript changes, causing various design elements to move. The sky moves first, followed by the moon, mountains, boat, and other elements. Additionally, the design transitions between day and night based on the moon's position within the design. This project serves as a practical application from a JavaScript course.
